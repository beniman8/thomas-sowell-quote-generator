This is a small python program that generates random quotes from thomas sowell one of my favorite writers




We have about 782 quotes !!!!


## How to run the program

First thing is you need to create a virtual Environement.

Go to your terminal and cd into the file that you install this program.

Type this in your terminal to create the Virtual environement.
```bash
virtualenv venv

```

Once you created the virtual environement you need to install all the requirements.

Type this in your terminal to first activate your virtual environement.

Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate

```

result:

```result
(venv) C:\You-directory\thomas-sowell-quote-generator

```

You will see your venv right beside the directory in your shell.


Now you can install the requirements !

Type this in your terminal:

```pip

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

You will see all your package getting installed and you can now run the program
named get_quote_gui.py, if you want to run it on a gui.

There is 2 type of csv file stored with quotes.
Our GUI program use the thomas_sowell_quotes_short.csv.
All this to make sure that our text fit on the gui.

Or 

get_a_quote.py if you want to run it on your terminal

Our terminal program use the thomas_sowell_quotes.csv.
which has all the quote visible for you to see.

Enjoy The program and hopefully you can learn something !!!
